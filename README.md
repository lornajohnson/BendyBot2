# BendyBot2 is a second attempt at a virtual assistant for people with a hypermobility spectrum disorder and autonomic dysfunction.   Its primary goal is to help people when they have "brain fog" or are experiencing a flare-up of their condition, or both.   When you have a flare-up or have severe brain fog, your normal abilities seem to shrivel up, and even the simplest thing can seem like a mountain to climb.  Bendy folk are encouraged to have a flare-up plan of what they will do, eat, etc. when they are severely affected.  The problem is, that you've got to find it and read it or remember it.  Even this can be challenging in a bad flare-up or case of brain fog.   The idea of BendyBot2 is to capture as much of your flare-up plan as possible into the virtual assistant, so that you (or your helper) can access it when you need it.   Since speech and the ability to type can be affected, BendyBot2 has options to use buttons to indicate what you want.   This makes it a little less like a fluid conversation than an earlier prototype, but hopefully increases its usefulness for this particular need.
